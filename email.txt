I hope you're doing well.

I would like to request leave from [start date] to [end date] to manage my Gruhapravesh ceremony. This event requires my full attention and presence, and I want to ensure everything goes smoothly.

I have made arrangements to complete my pending tasks before my leave and have briefed [colleague's name] to handle any urgent matters in my absence. I'll also be reachable via phone or email if needed.

Thank you for considering my request. I'll make sure to return to work refreshed and ready to resume my responsibilities.
